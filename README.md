# master-thesis
This repository contains my master thesis report "[Improving Debugging For Optimized Rust Code](./thesis.pdf)" and notes.

See this [git repository](https://github.com/Blinningjr/master-thesis-presentation.git) for the master thesis presentation.

The code for my [debugging library](https://github.com/Blinningjr/rust-debug), [debugger](https://github.com/Blinningjr/embedded-rust-debugger) and VSCode [extension](https://github.com/Blinningjr/embedded-rust-debugger-vscode) are in these separate repositories.
