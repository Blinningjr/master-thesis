% Describe the test setup to verify that your problems from 1.3 have been solved.
% This can be done in different ways depending on focus of your problems.
% Some problems may purely objective, such as "improve the performance of X compared to Y".
% These are easy to evaluate since you simply need to compare the performance, and perhaps compare against a few more technologies that you have listed in Section 2 (related work).
% In other cases the problems may be very subjective, such as "Create a mobile app that can be used while driving, and which shows the most fuel efficient time to change gear".
% This problem will require a user-study in which several persons drive without the application, you calculate the fuel consumption, then they drive with the application and then you calculate the fuel consumption again.
% Then you collect the objective measurements (fuel consumption comparisons) and the subjective opinions from the users about whether the application was unobtrusive, usable, etc. (typically via a questionnaire).

\section{Evaluating \emph{rust-debug}} \label{sec:evalrd}
The debugging library \emph{rust-debug} aims to solve the problem of getting debug information from the \gls{DWARF} format.
It requires many lines of code and knowledge about the \gls{DWARF} format to get the wanted debug information.
One way to measure if \emph{rust-debug} makes it easier is to compare the number of code lines required to create a debugger with and without \emph{rust-debug}.


Unfortunately, no other debugger has a similar feature set as \gls{erdb}.
Therefore, it would be unfair to compare \gls{erdb} with a debugger like \emph{GDB}, which has many more features.


Instead, the number of lines in \emph{rust-debug} will be compared against the debugger module in \gls{erdb}.
The number of \emph{Rust} code lines was counted using the tool \emph{tokei} \cite{tokei}.
\emph{Rust-debug} contains $3626$ lines of \emph{Rust} code, and the debugger module contains $1358$ lines.
Note that the whole debugger \gls{erdb} contains $3068$ lines of \emph{Rust} code.


The amount of \emph{Rust} code in \emph{rust-debug} is more than double that of the debugger module in \gls{erdb}.
Therefore, \emph{rust-debug} has made it significantly easier to get some debug information.



\section{Evaluating \emph{ERDB}} % TODO
One of the requirements in section \ref{sec:problemDef} is that \gls{erdb} must implement some of the most common debugging features.
A list of these features can be found in section \ref{sec:delimitations}.
\gls{erdb} implements all of those mentioned features, but two are not fully supported.


\gls{erdb} only supports hardware breakpoints, limiting how many breakpoints can be set.
The number of breakpoints can be increased significantly by implementing software breakpoints.


The other feature that is not fully supported are the different stepping variants.
Stepping one machine code instruction is currently the only supported stepping function, and it would have been beneficial if it supported stepping one source code instruction.


One of the main goals of \gls{erdb} is to improve the user experience by mainly removing the hassle of using an external program to debug embedded systems.
\gls{erdb} has achieved this goal by using the \emph{probe-rs} library.
\emph{Probe-rs} allows \gls{erdb} to access the debug target without starting another program, significantly improving the user experience.
There is also a \emph{VSCode} extension for \gls{erdb} that makes the user experience as good as other debuggers.



\section{Debugger Comparison} % TODO
\label{sec:debuggercomparison}
The debugger \gls{erdb} needs to be compared to the already existing debuggers to see if any improvement is made to debugging optimized \emph{Rust} code.
The two most popular debuggers used for debugging \emph{Rust} code are \emph{GDB} and \emph{LLDB}.
They are also the two debuggers supported by the \emph{Rust} development team, according to the \emph{rustc-dev-guide} \cite{rust-dev-guide}.


The testing and comparison of the three different debuggers are made manually on some example code.
See the git repository \cite{example-code} for the example code.
The example code was modified to test how well the three debuggers handled different situations.


A breakpoint was added to the same machine code instructions to keep the comparison fair when comparing the debugger.
It ensures that all three debuggers stop on the same instruction.
Also, the latest released version of each compiler was used to keep the comparison fair.
The latest versions of debuggers are:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{GDB} 12.1
    \item \emph{LLDB} 14.0.6
    \item \gls{erdb} 0.2.0 % TODO: Do a release
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Unoptimized Code Comparison}
All the debuggers were first tested on unoptimized \emph{Rust} code to see that the debuggers were correctly installed and configured.
While testing them, there were some differences between the debuggers that are interesting.
The most significant is that \emph{LLDB} cannot evaluate \emph{Rust} enums, which both \emph{GDB} and \emph{ERDB} can.


Another difference was that both \emph{LLDB} and \emph{GDB} evaluated an \emph{f32} to $10.1999998$, and \gls{erdb} evaluated it to $10.2$.
In the \emph{Rust} source code, the \emph{f32} was assigned the value of $10.2$.
All the debuggers returned that the raw bytes were $0x33332341$ in hexadecimal, and reading those raw bytes as a $32$-bit float using little endian gives $10.2$.



\subsection{Optimized Code Comparison}
Debugging the code with optimization $2$, \emph{LLDB} differed slightly from the other two debuggers.
It is still not able to evaluate \emph{Rust} enums.
Also, it wrote all $8$-bit integers in hexadecimal format, but the values were correct.


\emph{GDB} differed in that it evaluated all the $64$-bit integers as $32$-bit integers.
Therefore, it showed the wrong values and did not have this problem when debugging the same code but unoptimized.


Compared to the other debuggers, \gls{erdb} had no problems evaluating variables.
However, it sometimes does not give the correct stack trace when there are inline functions, and this problem has only occurred on optimized code.


All three debuggers were equally bad regarding the main problem of debugging optimized code: the problem of many variables being optimized out.
That makes it very hard to understand what is happening in the program and, therefore, difficult to debug.
