% This is not a step-by-step instruction or diary to your work.
% Instead, you should describe your technical approach and solution, describe architecture, components, etc.
% Think software engineering...
% Perhaps use a few useful uml-diagrams or illustrate the system architecture.
% Keep in mind that the purpose of the implementation section is to describe your implementation to solve the problems from 1.3.
 
% This section can have a lot of subsections, example:
% 4.1 System architecture / System arkitektur
% 4.2 System components / System komponenter
% 4.3 ...

The implementation is separate into three different smaller projects.
The fist being a debug library called \emph{rust-debug}, this library simplifies the process of retrieving debug information from the \gls{DWARF} format.
The second project is the debugger \gls{erd} and the last one is a \emph{VSCode} extension for \gls{erd}.
