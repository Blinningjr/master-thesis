% Example: if you are working on a social networking component which is to aggregate real-time data to automatically update your status in the social network, then your related work is not about other social networks but about different aggregation techniques, activity recognition solutions, etc.


The \gls{LLDB} project is a debugger that uses many of the libraries from the \gls{LLVM} project.
This debugger has the benefit of using the same libraries that the \emph{Rust} compiler uses.
It is also one of the most commonly used debugger for debugging \emph{Rust} code.
There is a wrapper made for \gls{LLDB} to give better printing for \emph{Rust} types made by the \emph{Rust} team called \emph{rust-lldb}.
But \gls{LLDB} does not list \emph{Rust} as a support language on there website \cite{lldb}.
