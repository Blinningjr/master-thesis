TODO
% This is really the section you should start writing first, even if it's located as 1.3.
% What scientific problems are you solving in your thesis.
% The reason why you should start defining these is that they define what you should write in all the other sections.
% The introduction gives an overview of the area of your problems.
% The background offers the background to why you are working with your problems.
% The motivation gives a motivation to why you are solving the problems.
% The related work described work which relates to your problems.
% The implementation describes how you have implemented a solution to your problems.
% The evaluation evaluates whether you have actually solved your problems.
% The discussion discusses each individual problem, how you addressed it, alternative solutions and shortcomings, etc.
% The conclusions and future work describes the final outcome of how you solved your problems and what is left to do. 
 
% If you write your problems first it is so much easier to write all the other sections because you already know what the focus of each section should be. It prevents a lot of the writers block that people often suffer from.
