TODO

% Equality and ethics are learning objectives for the program and should be reflected upon in the thesis if applicable.
% This section can be omitted if not at all relevant to the problem definition, but in many cases the thesis topic touches upon these topics even if it is outside the scope of the work itself and in such cases a single paragraph may be sufficient to cover the reflection.
