% Optimized rust code is up to 100 faster.
A motivation for this thesis is that optimized \emph{Rust} code can be $10-100$ times faster than unoptimized code according to the \emph{Rust} performance book \cite{perf-book}.
That is a very large difference in speed compared to other languages like \emph{C} for example, were the optimized code can be about 1-3 times faster than the unoptimized code as can be seen in the paper \cite{clang-opt}.
Thus for a language like \emph{C}, it is much more acceptable to not be able to debug optimized code because the difference is not that large compared to \emph{Rust} code.
But in the case of \emph{Rust}, the difference is so large that some programs are too slow to run without optimization.
This is a problem because debuggers are bad at debugging optimized code as explained in the introduction, and unoptimized code is to slow to run.
That is why there is a need for better debuggers that can provide a good experience for debugging optimized \emph{Rust} code.


% Debugging is not as important for rust, but is still needed for embedded systems
An argument against the need of debugging embedded systems is that the \emph{Rust} compiler will catch most of the errors.
This is especially true regarding pointers and memory access, which are two common causes of bugs in programming languages like \emph{C} and \emph{C++}.
Because most \emph{C} and \emph{C++} compilers have very few limitations on how pointers can be used, and the pointed to value can be removed without the pointer still exists. 
Thus, there is less need for a debugger that can debug \emph{Rust} code than there are debuggers that can debug \emph{C} and \emph{C++} code.
However, when it comes to embedded applications there is still a need for debugging with such a debugger.
One reason is because they use \emph{Memory-mapped I/O} to preform input/output (\emph{I/O}) between the \emph{CPU} and peripheral devices.
Thus a debugger can easily see how the two interact by inspecting the memory that is it mapped to.
Another reason is that it is more common to have hardware bugs, and a debugger can be used to verify that a problem comes from a hardware bug.


% Improving the state of debugging. % TODO: Rewrite this paragraph
Another motivation for creating a debugger for embedded systems is that the two supported debuggers for \emph{Rust} by the \emph{Rust} team are \emph{LLVM} and \emph{GDB}, which both requires another program to interact with the \gls{mcu}.
An example of such a program that is commonly used is \emph{openocd} (openocd homepage \cite{openocd}), which needs to be setup as a \emph{GDB} server that the debugger connects to.
This complicates the process of debugging and makes for a needlessly complex experience, especially for new developers.


% Contributing with a solution written in Rust.
Many of the debuggers used for debugging \emph{Rust} code are written in other programming languages, and there is not a lot of debugging tools written in \emph{Rust} yet.
Thus, one of the key motivations is to write a debugger in \emph{Rust}, which will also lead to the debugger having all the benefit of memory safety that \emph{Rust} provides.


%% Contributing a debug rust library / simplifying debugging.
%Another way this thesis contributes to the \emph{Rust} community is by making a library that simplifies the process of retrieving information from the debug information.
%This is important because it makes retrieving debug information simpler for new developers to start contributing to the \emph{Rust} debug community.
%Which will hopefully lead to more work being done on the compiler to improve the debugging situation for unoptimized and  optimized \emph{Rust} code.
