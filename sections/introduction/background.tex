% What has been done already, and why does this work need to be solved.
% Typically if the masters project is issued by a company it is because the company already has one part, but wish to improve it or extend it somehow.
% Describe the background to your work.


In the \emph{Rust} programming language community there is no large project focusing on creating a debugger.
There is even less focus on improving the debugging of optimized \emph{Rust} code.
One of the larger project focusing on debugging is called \emph{gimli-rs}, one of the main parts of the project is to make a \emph{Rust} library for reading the debugging format \gls{DWARF}.
Then there are other projects like \emph{probe-rs} that focus on making a library that provides different tools to interact with a range of \glspl{mcu} and debug probes.
One of there newest tools that has not been released yet is a debugger that uses the \emph{gimli-rs} library to read the \gls{DWARF} file.


When it comes to improving generation of debug information there is some work being done on the \emph{LLVM} project.
But there is no focus on improving debugging for optimized code.
