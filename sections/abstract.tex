Debugging is an essential part of programming.
No debugger is good at debugging optimized \emph{Rust} code, which is a problem because unoptimized \emph{Rust} code is slow compared to optimized.
The ability to debug optimized code is essential for embedded systems because of the close relation to hardware.
Therefore, a tool like a debugger is handy because it enables the developer to see what is happening in the hardware when debugging embedded systems. 

This thesis presents a debugger named \acrshort{erdb} and a debugging library named \emph{rust-debug}.
The goal of the library is to make it easier to create debugging tools by simplifying the process of retrieving debug information from the \acrshort{DWARF} format.
The goal of \acrshort{erdb} is to improve debugging for optimized \emph{Rust} code. 

This thesis will explain the design and implementation of \acrshort{erdb} and rust-debug, and it will also explain how the debug information format \acrshort{DWARF} works.

\acrshort{erdb} will be compared to other debuggers to see if it has achieved its goal.
The result highlight that the problem is in the compiler not generating the needed debug information.
