Debugging Rust code on embedded system today is not a very good experience for many reasons.
One of the big problems is debugging optimized code is often near impossible.
That is because the compilers today are very good at inlining the code and removing unused code.
This changes the program so drastically in many cases that when trying to debug the code all the original variable can be optimized out.
Thus the user doesn't get any useful information from the debugger about the program which makes is near impossible to debug.
One of the big reasons why variable gets optimized out is because unoptimized code always push the value of the variable to memory which then can be read by the debugger at anytime.
This is not done for optimized code because speed is prioritized and storing the value of a variable that will not be used on the stack is costly.Thus the time that most variable exist is very short in optimized code which results in that the debugger saying that a variable is optimized out.
