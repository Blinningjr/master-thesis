% Explain the implementation of the vscode explanation.
The \emph{VSCode} extension for the debugger \emph{Embedded Rust Debugger} is a very simple and bare bones implementation.
\emph{Microsoft} provides an \gls{api} which can be used to start a debugging session and some trackers for logging.
The implementation of the extensions uses that \gls{api} to create a debugging session and a tracker that logs all the sent and received messages, it also logs all the errors.
There are some configuration done to the debugging session, most of it is for the \gls{dap} messages being sent.
All of the code for the extension is in the \emph{GIT} repository \cite{erd-vscode}.
