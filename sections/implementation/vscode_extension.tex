% Explain the implementation of the vscode explanation.
The \emph{VSCode} extension for the debugger \emph{Embedded Rust Debugger} is a very simple and bare bones implementation.
\emph{Microsoft} provides \emph{API} which can be used to starting a debugging session and trackers for loging what is happening in the debugging session.
The implementation of the extensions uses the \emph{API} to create a tracker that logs all the sent and received messages, it also logs all the errors.
It also creates a session that tries to connect to a \acrshort{dap} server on a configurable port or uses a already existing session.
Then there is some extra arguments added to the configuration \acrshort{dap} message sent to the debug adapter.
